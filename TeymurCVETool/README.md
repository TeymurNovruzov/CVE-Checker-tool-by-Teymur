## Description
This tool allows users to check the details of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) by providing the CVE ID. It fetches information such as the state of the CVE, affected vendors, base score, vector, references, and more.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests
- Selenium
- Firefox Web Browser (GeckoDriver)

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Install dependencies using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install flask requests selenium
    ```
3. Make sure you have Firefox installed and download GeckoDriver from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). Make sure to place the GeckoDriver executable in your system's PATH.
4. Clone or download this repository.
5. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
6. Run the following command to start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
7. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
